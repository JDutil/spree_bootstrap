SpreeBootstrap
==============

**NOTICE: This repo was built for Bootstrap 2 & Spree 2.x, and will not be updated for Bootstrap 3 & Spree 3.  There is a newer more promising alternative being developed for the latest versions of Spree and Bootstrap 3 located at [https://github.com/200Creative/spree_bootstrap_frontend](https://github.com/200Creative/spree_bootstrap_frontend) please check it out if your looking for a newer version!**

This project aims to replace the spree_frontend's use of the skeleton css framework in favor of Twitter Bootstrap.
